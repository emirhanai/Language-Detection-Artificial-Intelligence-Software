# Language Detection Artificial Intelligence Software - By Emirhan BULUT

I developed 'Language Detection Artificial Intelligence Software'. I share this software with all humanity for free from Kaggle and GitHub. It is an NLP system.
The sensitivity score is quite high and the accuracy score is in a very advantageous position. It has 97% accuracy and 98.4% sensitivity score.
I share Dataset and Artificial Intelligence Software as open source. I used the Ridge Classifier algorithm and manipulated the dataset to improve the algorithm. In this way, the sensitivity rate and score of the software has been increased. In addition, I adapted the data according to the algorithm and made the algorithm work. In this study, it was studied on the data, not on the algorithm.

I wish conveniences,
